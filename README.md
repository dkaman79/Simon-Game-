# Simon-Game
This project is based on pattern behavioural game wherein the user is to follow the color patterns and choose the right paatern.
It helped build logic in JS.
With the help of skeleton HTML & CSS , i was able to write the Javascript codes according to the rquirement of the game.
A tad bit of JQuery was also used in the project.
